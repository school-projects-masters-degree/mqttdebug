# Idea
![left:40% 80%](./images/paper.png)
* Quickly view latest messages of your MQTT broker
* Just type in your URL, username & password
* And off you go...

# Problem to solve
## Imagine:
* You like home automation
* You donâ€˜t like your data being on the cloud
* You want FULL control
* Which means, you need to care about it on your own
* You need to self-host your MQTT-Broker
* Upon Installation of new devices
* You need to ensure correct messages are sent
* **And this is where MQTTDebug comes into play!**
